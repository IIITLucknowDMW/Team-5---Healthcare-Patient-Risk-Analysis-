# Healthcare Patient Risk Analysis

This project implements a machine learning pipeline to analyze patient data for heart disease risk. It uses the UCI Heart Disease dataset (Cleveland) to detect outliers, cluster patients into risk groups, and predict disease presence.

## Project Structure
- `risk_analysis_pipeline.py`: Main script containing the analysis logic.
- `insights_report.md`: Detailed report of the findings and model performance.
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies.
- `heart_disease_uci.csv`: Dataset.

## Setup and Usage
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Run the pipeline:
   ```bash
   python risk_analysis_pipeline.py
   ```
   This will generate the analysis metrics and visualization images.

## Results
See `insights_report.md` for a detailed breakdown of the clusters and model accuracy.
